### Tips And Tricks

Below are some practical tips and tricks you may consider when using this process.

* Start with a simple process (like above) and a simple tool (like Weka), then advance once you have confidence.
* Begin with the simplest and most used datasets (iris flowers and Pima diabetes).
* Each time you apply the process, look for ways to improve it and your usage of it.
* If you discover new methods, figure out the best way to integrate them into your process.
* Study algorithms, but only as much and in ways that help you achieve better results with your process.
* Study and learn from experts and see what methods you can steal and add to your process.
* Study your tool like you do predictive modeling problems and get the most out of it.
* Tackle harder and harder problems, leave the easy ones as you wonâ€™t learn much from them.
* Focus on clearly presenting results, the better you do this, the greater the impact of your portfolio.
* Engage in the community on forums and Q&A sites, both ask and answer questions.
